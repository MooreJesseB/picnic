#PICNIQ#

##Description##
Crowd sourced photo sharing app. (incomplete)

Premise:

 - A user drops a pin at a specific location on Google Maps.
 
  - The user then writes a description of what they want a photo taken of at that location.
  
   - Another user near the newly created request's location gets an alert that they are close to a photo request.
   
   - Second user looks up the request description and snaps a photo of the desired target.
   
   - Second user then uploads their photo to the Picniq app for approval from the requester.
   
   - Once approved by the initial user the photo can then be commented on or upvoted/downvoted by other users.
   
   - A record of all photos for a certain request is kept unless request creator or submitter decides to remove them.
    
   - Potential for monetization where requestors can put a 'bounty' on specific requests paid to submitters upon approval.
